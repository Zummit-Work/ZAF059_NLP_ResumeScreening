### **Resume screening** is the process of reviewing and evaluating resumes submitted by job applicants to determine if they meet the minimum qualifications for the job. It involves a number of steps, including:

* **Reviewing resumes for basic qualifications**: The first step in resume screening involves looking for basic qualifications, such as relevant work experience, education, and skills. This helps to narrow down the pool of applicants and identify those who meet the minimum requirements for the job.

* **Scanning resumes for keywords**: Many employers use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to scan resumes for keywords that match the job description. This helps to identify resumes that are most relevant to the job and filter out those that are not a good fit.

* **Assessing resumes for relevant experience**: Once resumes have been narrowed down, the next step is to assess them for relevant experience. This involves looking at job titles, job duties, and accomplishments to determine if the applicant has the skills and experience necessary for the job.

* **Evaluating resumes for soft skills**: In addition to technical skills and experience, employers also look for soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. Resumes can provide clues about these skills through the applicant's previous work experience, education, and volunteer work.

* **Comparing resumes to job requirements**: Finally, employers compare resumes to the job requirements to determine which applicants are the best fit for the job. This involves looking at the applicant's qualifications, experience, and skills in relation to the specific requirements of the job.

Overall, resume screening is an important step in the hiring process that helps employers to identify the most qualified candidates for the job.
